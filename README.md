# Extended Kalman Filter

In this project I will utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. 

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see the uWebSocketIO Starter Guide page in the classroom within the EKF Project lesson for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF

**INPUT**: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


**OUTPUT**: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x

["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y

["rmse_x"]

["rmse_y"]

["rmse_vx"]

["rmse_vy"]

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
4. Run it: `./ExtendedKF `

## Project Explained
The project consist of the implementation of Extended Kalman Filter on Laser and Radar measurements received via simulator. The logic for Kalman filter is in `kalman_filter.cpp` files and the sensor fusion of measurements and usage of predict and update steps of Kalman filter are in `FusionEKF.cpp` file.
The goal of project was to minimize the RMSE on estimation and ground truth provided by the simulator.

In this project the following results were consistently produced:

| Parameters      | RMSE |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| x      | 0.0974      |
| y   | 0.0855      |
| vx   | 0.4517      |
| vy   | 0.4404      |

where `x`,`y` are coordinates of predicted object in Cartesian coordinate system, and `vx` and `Vy` are the objects respective speeds.
